# Yunnan-Architectural-Heritage-POI-Data

## Introduction
The architectural heritage contains rich cultural deposits and has important historical, artistic, and scientific values. The study of architectural heritage in Yunnan Province provides a physical example for historical, scientific research. It is also an important material basis for promoting the development of tourism, which is conducive to improving the efficiency of resource allocation and enhancing the impetus and vitality of cultural and tourism development in the province. Based on the eight batches of national architectural heritage lists successively released by The State Council, the author extracted the architectural heritage data of Yunnan Province from them and used the Baidu map service interface to extract the geographical coordinates of each architectural heritage to obtain the spatial distribution data set of 306 architectural heritage sites in Yunnan Province. The data set includes the name, era, address, cultural relic category, batch, and other information on architectural heritage in Yunnan Province. The data set is stored in.shp and.xls formats and consists of 8 files with a data volume of 521KB.

## Background of dataset research
The construction techniques of Yunnan's ancient architecture, closely combined with local selection thinking and the flexible application of various ethnic folk crafts, have created extremely rich architectural forms with strong local architectural characteristics, containing important historical, artistic, and scientific value. At the same time, protecting architectural heritage is a requirement of national development strategy. The protection of architectural heritage in Yunnan Province faces difficulties such as geological disaster damage and man-made damage, so dataset on it is urgent.
